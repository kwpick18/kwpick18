### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a student at St. Lawrence University currently using GitHub for my Data Visualization class with Professor Higham. 

I am set to graduate at the end of this spring semester 2022 with a major in Economics and Minor in Statistics. 

I'm currently learning the ins and outs of Github and how to apply it to my practice in this class. Looking forward to learning more!
